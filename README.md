## good developer mindset 

There are common issues talkes about by developers.
also there aer some of stories made the developer crying.Why?

there are many small factors that slowly harm developer's project 

**Some key points every developer must ahve :**

1. Conceiving the purpose of software 
    - 'the purpose of software is not to show off how intelligent you are' Max Kanat-Alexander 
    - if you dont understand the purpose and the aim you will have a bad software 

2. the goals of software design 
    - '' Every programmer is a designer '' 
    - the design of software aims to make developers job as easy as posssibale so they can focus on what matters.
    - there are tow key points here : 
      1. your design should be easy for you 
      2. should be helpful for others 
3. (Mis) understanding 

    - complex system raise from not fully undertand the work 
    - ' Understanding is the key difference bteween a bad developer and a good developer '
4. Simplicity
    - a good developer creates thing that are easy to understand so that it is really easy to shake out all the bugs 
    - you should not show off that you are smart so you ddont help them 
    - developers need to learn how to cupe with your code 
5. complexity
    - you start with a one task and over time you will incremment the work this will lead to more and more complexity in your project 
    - try to prevent your code from unnecessary codes 
    - Your main purpose is to control complexity , not to creae it 
6. Maintenance 
    - your work is not just to implement the code but , you also have to maintain the system over time 
    - ' it is more important to rreduce the effort of maintenance than it sis to reduce the effort of implementation ' Max Kanat-Alexander
7. Consistency
    - is a big part of simplicit 
    - reflect the same changes into all your code 
    - code that is not consistent becomes harder to undersranf over time 
8. Prioritizing 
    - factors will help you to make a better decision
      1. the desirablility of a change (D)
      2. the value of a change (V)
      3. the effort required to perform the change (E)
    - the equation is D = V/E
9. Solving problems 
    - Think before acting 
    - steps to solve 
      1. understanding 
      2. planning 
      3. dividing 
10. good enough is fine 
    - Start small, improve it, the extend 
    - there is no new version perfect 
    - the incremental design should be your guide 
11. predictions 
    - Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed.
    - “A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption.”
    - Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
12. Assumptions 
    - “An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof.”
    - the greatest killer of software projects
    - the developers think a lot in futuer and they implement some of codes then in the futuer they discover that they did not need that codes which lead to big structural problems 
    - code should be designed bsed on what you know now , not on what you think will happen in the futuer 
13. stop reinventing 
    - reinventing will be right if 
      1. you need something that doesnt exist yet 
      2. all of the existing 'wheels' are bad tech or incapable of handling your needs 
      3. the existing 'wheels' are not being properly mantained
14. resistnace
    - as a developer , your first reaction to changing wiill be "NO"
    - go back an remember your soft purpose 
    -then remember the simple equation in prioritzing section 
15. automation 
    - dont waste your time 
    - if you can automate it , Automate it 
    - they can work while you are doing something else 
16. code measuerment 
    - measuring the progeramm by lines of code 
    - there is no need to a lot of code lines if the problem was simple 
    - the best code is small group of instructions that should be eay and readable 
17. Productivity 
    - your main goal should br keeping your code base as small as possible 
    - the right question is "how can i ramove more codes ? "                
18. testing 
    - you should be raliable 
    when ohter developers in your  team see that you commited new code to source control 
    everyone should know that your code is tested and works 
    - Untested code is the code that does not work
19. estimation 
    - do not underestimate things rather than overestimate 
    - break the big into smaller thing 
    - even small as possible will be easier to estimate 
    - everything takes longer than you think
20. running away from rewriting 
    - why ?
      - well , because it is harder to code than to write it 
      - there are many cases that you should consider to rewrite your code form scratch and you can read them 
      -refactoring should be the first option 
21. documentation and commenting 
    - type in your comments 'why' not 'what'
    - the aim of comments is why you did write the code 
    - documenting is very important to explain how the system's components 
22. Picking technologies (tools , liraries ,etc)
    - dont depend on external technologies but, when you have to do so , try reduce your dependency on them as much as you can 
    - you will not free if you are depend on huge external technologies 
    - few factors you should take in yours 
        1. is there active development behind it ? 
        2. will it continue to be maintanied ?
        3. how easy is it to switch from >
23. self-development 
    - keep learning diff programming languages 
    - be open-minded 
    - dont be in unnecessary discusion like microsoft or linux ?

24. dont be a hero
    - a lot if times it is better to be quitter than a hero 
    - font be obsessive .know when to quit , dont hesitate ti ask for help 
25. Dont ask fora question ...ask for help 

**I strongly recommend to read these carfuly and applicate it step by step**
